-- =====================================================================
-- Legacy RAQBO update for projects still using Supabase Auth UUIDs.
-- Do not run this after switching to Firebase Auth; run firebase_auth_migration.sql
-- followed by schema.sql instead.
-- Adds: advertisers can edit & delete their own listings (edits go back to review),
--       spam limits, and enquiries/reports only from signed-in verified users.
-- Safe to run more than once.
